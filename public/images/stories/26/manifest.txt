# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===
# These images would help visualize the key analogies in the story

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Supply and Demand|Like two dancers in a waltz—supply loves high prices and spins faster when they rise, demand loves low prices and leaps when they fall, and they meet in the middle at equilibrium
