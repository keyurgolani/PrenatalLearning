# Instructions:
# 1. Create images based on the suggested descriptions below
# 2. Save image files with the suggested filenames (or update the filename field)
# 3. Place image files in public/images/stories/2/

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===
# These images would help visualize the key analogies in the story

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Spacetime Curvature|A bowling ball on a trampoline—the heavy ball creates a dip, and marbles roll around it following the curved surface
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Orbits|Throwing a ball so hard that as it falls, the Earth curves away beneath it—it keeps falling but never lands
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Weightlessness|Being in a falling elevator—everything falls together at the same rate, so you float inside
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Black Holes|A trampoline stretched so far down by something so heavy that it becomes a bottomless pit
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Gravitational Waves|Ripples spreading across a pond when you drop a stone—but the pond is spacetime itself
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Universal Attraction|Invisible strings connecting everything in the universe, with bigger things having stronger strings

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM KEY CONCEPTS ===
# These images would help illustrate the main concepts

# coreContent|inline|concept-0.png|Illustration of: Gravity is the force that attracts all objects with mass toward each other|Gravity is the force that attracts all objects with mass toward each other
# coreContent|inline|concept-1.png|Illustration of: Newton discovered that the same gravity that makes apples fall keeps the Moon orbiting Earth|Newton discovered that the same gravity that makes apples fall keeps the Moon orbiting Earth
# coreContent|inline|concept-2.png|Illustration of: Einstein revealed that gravity is actually the bending of spacetime by massive objects|Einstein revealed that gravity is actually the bending of spacetime by massive objects
# coreContent|inline|concept-3.png|Illustration of: Objects in orbit are actually falling, but moving sideways fast enough to keep missing|Objects in orbit are actually falling, but moving sideways fast enough to keep missing
# coreContent|inline|concept-4.png|Illustration of: Time moves slower near massive objects—gravity bends time as well as space|Time moves slower near massive objects—gravity bends time as well as space
# coreContent|inline|concept-5.png|Illustration of: Black holes are places where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light|Black holes are places where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light
