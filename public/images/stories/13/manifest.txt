# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===
# These images would help visualize the key analogies in the story

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Mathematics as Language|Mathematics is like a secret code that the universe uses to write everything—from the spiral of a galaxy to the pattern of a snowflake
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Zero|Zero is like a quiet hero—it looks like nothing, but it makes everything possible, like the silence between musical notes that makes the music meaningful
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Fibonacci in Nature|Nature uses Fibonacci numbers like a recipe—the same ingredients (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...) appear in sunflowers, pinecones, and seashells
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Golden Ratio|The Golden Ratio is like nature's favorite proportion—a recipe for beauty that appears in galaxies, hurricanes, and even the proportions of your own body
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Universal Language|If we met aliens, we might not share words, but we would share mathematics—like two strangers who can't speak but can both understand music
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Patterns in the Body|Your body is a mathematical symphony—your heartbeat is the rhythm, your DNA is the score, and your growth follows the conductor's precise timing
