# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===
# These images would help visualize the key analogies in the story

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Packet Switching|Cutting a painting into a thousand pieces, sending each through different routes, and reassembling at the destination—faster and more reliable than one truck carrying the whole thing
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of TCP Protocol|A careful librarian who numbers every page, checks that all pages arrived, puts them in order, and asks for any missing pages to be sent again
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of IP Addresses|Street addresses for computers—unique numbers that tell packets exactly where to go, like house numbers on a global street
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Routers|Traffic directors at every intersection who know all the roads and tell each car (packet) the best way to reach its destination
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of DNS|A giant phone book that translates friendly names (google.com) into computer numbers (172.217.14.206), shared by everyone and updated automatically
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Undersea Cables|Rivers of light flowing across ocean floors, carrying 99% of international internet traffic through cables as wide as a garden hose
# coreContent|after|analogy-6.png|Illustration of The Internet|A postal system made of light, where billions of tiny messages crisscross the globe every second, each finding its own path to the destination
