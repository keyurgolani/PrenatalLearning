# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===

coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Tree of Life|A vast family tree where every living thing is a branch or leaf, all connected to the same trunk and roots
coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Natural Selection|Like a filter that lets through the creatures best suited to their environment, allowing helpful traits to become more common over generations
coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Common Ancestry|All life is like a huge extended family reunion—every creature is a cousin, some close and some very distant
coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Adaptation|Like how a family might develop different skills depending on where they live—mountain families become good climbers, coastal families become good swimmers
coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Fossil Record|A photo album of life's history, showing snapshots of how creatures looked at different times in the past
coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Shared DNA|Like finding the same family recipes in the cookbooks of distant relatives—proof that you share ancestors
coreContent|after|analogy-6.png|Illustration of Vestigial Structures|Like old family heirlooms that no longer serve their original purpose but remind us of our ancestors
