# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Probability|Probability is like a measuring stick for uncertainty—it doesn't tell us exactly what will happen, but it measures how likely different outcomes are
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Gambler's Fallacy|Thinking a coin is 'due' for heads after many tails is like thinking a coin has a memory—but coins don't remember, each flip is a fresh start
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Law of Large Numbers|Individual coin flips are unpredictable, but flip a million coins and you'll get very close to half heads—like how one raindrop's path is random, but rain still fills the bucket
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Expected Value|Expected value is like calculating your average score before playing a game many times—it tells you if the game is worth playing
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Conditional Probability|Learning new information changes probability like turning on a light in a dark room—suddenly you can see which possibilities are still there
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Birthday Paradox|The birthday paradox is surprising because we forget how many pairs of people there are—like forgetting how many handshakes happen when everyone shakes hands with everyone
