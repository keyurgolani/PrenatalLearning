# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===
# These images would help visualize the key analogies in the story

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Wave-Particle Duality|A friend who is somehow both a fish and a bird—swimming when in water, flying when in sky, but genuinely both all the time
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Superposition|A magical coin that is both heads AND tails while spinning, only choosing when you catch it and look
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Quantum Observation|A cosmic game of hide-and-seek where particles spread out when not watched but snap into position when observed
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Entanglement|Two gloves from the same pair—finding a left glove in New York instantly tells you the Tokyo glove is right, but no message was sent
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Uncertainty Principle|Photographing a hummingbird—freeze position and lose wing motion, capture motion and lose position
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Decoherence|Quantum fuzziness that disappears when things get big, like ripples that fade in a busy pond

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM KEY CONCEPTS ===
# These images would help illustrate the main concepts
