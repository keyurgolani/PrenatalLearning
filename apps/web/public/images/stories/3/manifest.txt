# Format: sectionName|position|filename|altText|caption
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Create images based on the suggested descriptions below
# 2. Save image files with the suggested filenames (or update the filename field)
# 3. Place image files in public/images/stories/3/
# 4. Remove the # prefix from lines you have created images for to activate them
# 5. Position options: before, after, inline
#
# IMPORTANT: Entries are commented out by default.
# Uncomment an entry (remove the leading #) ONLY when the image file exists.

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Wave-Particle Duality|A friend who is somehow both a fish and a bird—swimming when in water, flying when in sky, but genuinely both all the time
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Superposition|A magical coin that is both heads AND tails while spinning, only choosing when you catch it and look
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Quantum Observation|A cosmic game of hide-and-seek where particles spread out when not watched but snap into position when observed
