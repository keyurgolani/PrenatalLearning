# Instructions:
# 1. Create images based on the suggested descriptions below
# 2. Save image files with the suggested filenames (or update the filename field)
# 3. Place image files in public/images/stories/6/
# 4. Remove the # prefix from lines you have created images for to activate them
# 5. Position options: before, after, inline
#
# IMPORTANT: Entries are commented out by default.
# Uncomment an entry (remove the leading #) ONLY when the image file exists.

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Machine Learning|A robot who learned to paint not by following rules, but by studying millions of paintings and noticing patterns
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Neural Networks|A team of friends passing messages—each layer receives information, processes it, and passes refined messages forward
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Training Process|Like learning from mistakes—guess, get feedback, adjust, try again, millions of times until you get it right
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Supervised Learning|Learning with a teacher who shows you examples with correct answers: "This is a cat. This is a dog."
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Reinforcement Learning|Learning through play—try something, see what happens, do more of what works, like learning a game
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Pattern Recognition|A super-powered pattern finder that can spot connections in millions of examples that would take humans years to discover
# coreContent|after|analogy-6.png|Illustration of Deep Learning|Neural networks with hundreds of layers, like a very tall building where each floor refines the understanding further
