# Instructions:
# 1. Create images based on the suggested descriptions below
# 2. Save image files with the suggested filenames (or update the filename field)
# 3. Place image files in public/images/stories/5/
# 4. Remove the # from lines you have created images for
# 5. Position options: before, after, inline

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===
# These images would help visualize the key analogies in the story

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Binary System|A kingdom where there are only two things: light and darkness, on and off—every message is made from just these two simple things
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Transistors|Microscopic light switches so tiny that billions fit on a chip smaller than your thumbnail
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of AND Gate|A gate that only opens when two friends knock together—both must knock for it to open
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of OR Gate|A gate that opens if either friend knocks—one knock or the other will open it
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of NOT Gate|A silly gate that does the opposite of what you tell it—say open, it closes; say close, it opens
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of CPU|A very fast, very organized chef reading recipes (programs), gathering ingredients (data), and creating wonderful dishes (output)
# coreContent|after|analogy-6.png|Illustration of Computer Evolution|From ENIAC weighing as much as several elephants to smartphones with more power than existed in the entire world when grandparents were born

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM KEY CONCEPTS ===
# These images would help illustrate the main concepts
