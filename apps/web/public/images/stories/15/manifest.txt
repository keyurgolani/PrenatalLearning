# Format: sectionName|position|filename|altText|caption
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Create images based on the suggested descriptions below
# 2. Save image files with the suggested filenames (or update the filename field)
# 3. Place image files in public/images/stories/15/
# 4. Remove the # prefix from lines you have created images for to activate them
# 5. Position options: before, after, inline
#
# IMPORTANT: Entries are commented out by default.
# Uncomment an entry (remove the leading #) ONLY when the image file exists.

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM ANALOGIES ===

# coreContent|after|analogy-0.png|Illustration of Fibonacci Sequence|The Fibonacci sequence is like nature's favorite recipe—the same ingredients (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...) appear in sunflowers, pinecones, and seashells, creating beauty through simple addition
# coreContent|after|analogy-1.png|Illustration of Golden Ratio|The Golden Ratio is like nature's measuring tape—a proportion so pleasing that artists, architects, and evolution itself keep using it to create beauty
# coreContent|after|analogy-2.png|Illustration of Fractals|A fractal is like a hall of mirrors where each reflection contains smaller reflections, which contain even smaller reflections, going on forever
# coreContent|after|analogy-3.png|Illustration of Self-Similarity|Self-similarity is like Russian nesting dolls—open one and find a smaller version inside, open that and find an even smaller one, each looking like the original
# coreContent|after|analogy-4.png|Illustration of Koch Snowflake|The Koch snowflake is like a coastline you could walk forever—infinite length folded into finite space, complexity without end
# coreContent|after|analogy-5.png|Illustration of Fractal Branching|Your lungs are like an upside-down tree—branching and branching until a tennis court of surface area fits inside your chest

# === SUGGESTED IMAGES FROM KEY CONCEPTS ===

# coreContent|inline|concept-2.png|Illustration of: Fractals are patterns that repeat at every scale—small parts look like the whole|Fractals are patterns that repeat at every scale—small parts look like the whole
